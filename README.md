# Ditto Standalone

Clipboard manager and extender. Ditto is an extension to the standard windows clipboard. It saves each item placed on the clipboard allowing you access to any of those items at a later time. Ditto allows you to save any type of information that can be put on the clipboard, text, images, html, custom formats.


This is a personal project, and I'm not related with Ditto Team (https://ditto-cp.sourceforge.io/) or PortableApps (https://portableapps.com).
Only unpack and enjoy (unpack in PortableApps folder to integrate with him).

This is packed with Ditto Portable v3.24.214 with correct enviromet select (32 or 64 bit).

Any problems mail to > bremaya@gmail.com
